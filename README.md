# TankGame
It is an idea in my head that is persistent, but I may never finish.

The idea is to create a game very similar to Warzone 2100, 
but to make it more of the prespective of an overarching AI rather than a bird in the sky.

While I do welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement, 
the purpose of this project of is to get a better understanding of what happens in the background of games.
While there may be libraries capable of expiditing this process,
I wish to attempt this with mostly c++ libraries.
